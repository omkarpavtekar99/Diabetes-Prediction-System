**# Diabetes Prediction System**
**#Project Overview**
The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine learning-based project aimed at predicting whether an individual has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. This project utilizes a dataset of patient information and various machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model that can assist in early diagnosis.

**#Features**
- Data Loading: Load and preprocess the diabetes dataset to make it suitable for model training.
- Data Exploration: Basic exploration and visualization of the dataset to understand the distribution of the features and the target variable.
- Data Preprocessing: Standardize the data to bring all the features to the same scale.
- Model Building: Build and train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for predicting diabetes.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy as the metric.

**# Installation**
To run the notebook, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Additionally, you'll need to install the following libraries:


```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
**# Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Diabetes dataset, which includes several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). The predictor variables include:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
The target variable (Outcome) indicates whether the individual has diabetes (1) or not (0).

**# Usage**
- Load the Dataset: The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame from a CSV file.
- Preprocessing: The data is standardized using StandardScaler to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the distance calculations in the SVM model.
- Model Training: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and an SVM model is trained on the training data.
- Model Evaluation: The accuracy of the model is evaluated on the test set to determine how well the model can predict diabetes.

Code Example
Here’s a small snippet from the notebook that loads the data and trains the SVM model:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn import svm
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
diabetes_dataset = pd.read_csv('diabetes.csv')

# Split the data into features and target
X = diabetes_dataset.drop(columns='Outcome', axis=1)
Y = diabetes_dataset['Outcome']

# Standardize the data
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaler.fit(X)
X = scaler.transform(X)

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, stratify=Y, random_state=2)

# Train the model
classifier = svm.SVC(kernel='linear')
classifier.fit(X_train, Y_train)

# Evaluate the model
X_train_prediction = classifier.predict(X_train)
training_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(X_train_prediction, Y_train)

print(f"Accuracy on training data: {training_data_accuracy}")

```
**#Results**
The model is evaluated based on accuracy. Further evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC could be added to assess model performance more comprehensively.

**#Future Work**
- Feature Engineering: Explore additional features or combinations of features that could improve model performance.
- Model Optimization: Experiment with different machine learning algorithms or hyperparameters to improve accuracy.
- Cross-validation: Implement cross-validation to better assess the model’s generalizability.

**#Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to medical data to build predictive models that assist in the early detection of diseases such as diabetes. The model built in this notebook provides a foundation that can be expanded and refined for more complex and accurate predictions.
